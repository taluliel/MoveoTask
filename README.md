•	I have developed a client side project in JavaScript and React.

•	The project includes a webpage display with table of users which I have pulled from an API service using Axios.

•	The table contains an option to choose between 5 or 10 rows per page, and controls to move between pages. In addition, the table have a sorting option for each column.

•	The data that is displayed in the table for each user is: The user's picture, the first letter of his first and last name, email, gender and age.

•	By clicking on the email address link, a pop-up window will be displayed with an option to send an email to the chosen user. I used in EmailJS service for this feature.

•	Clicking on the user's row opens another page with the user's details and a map pinned on the coordinates of the user's address.

•	I used Material UI library for the design.
